# BBoutique Capstone Project.
**BB Boutique Android application** 

## Brief Overview of Problem
*During the research of my final year capstone project in masters, I came across a problem that people are wasting their 
time and money in shopping for the exact fittings clothes. After little bit of research I get to know that there is a concept
of custom fitted clothes but they are little costlier. When I dig little bit deeper, I got to know that there is an ample online
option for the men but very less for the women. So I teamed up with my sister who is having a boutique and learned the hassle 
which all the customers faces for just a piece of fabric.*

## Solution 
So the solution is Boutique android application which will be used by the customers to get custom fitted clothes without any 
struggle of going to the boutique selecting the design, fabric and then giving the measurement, and after that coming back to 
pickup your dress. This application will abstract all the inconvenice by asking the customer some set of body shape question 
which will help the dressmaker to create a dress without taking there actual measurement in person. Delivery is also handled 
by the boutique owner with a return slip if there is some fitting issues.
